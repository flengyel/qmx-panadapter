# QMX+ Panadapter

*Based on original work by Zhenxing Han (N6HAN); QMX/QMX+ Panadapter adaptation and current project by Steffen Lav (OZ1LAV); fork maintenance and Codex-assisted adaptation by Florian Lengyel (WM2D).*

A standalone real-time panadapter — spectrum analyzer and waterfall — for the [QRP Labs QMX/QMX+](https://www.qrp-labs.com/qmxp.html) HF transceiver, running on the [M5Stack Tab5](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/tab5) (ESP32-P4 with a 5" 720×1280 touch display).

The QMX exposes I/Q audio over USB UAC plus CAT control over USB CDC-ACM. The Tab5 connects to the QMX as a USB host, decodes the I/Q in real time on the ESP32-P4, and renders a touch-driven panadapter with tap-to-tune.

![Panadapter on M5Stack Tab5 — QMX+ tuned to 14.074 MHz, FT8 traffic visible](docs/QMX-Panadapter_v0.9.2.png)

*The panadapter live on hardware in flat-spectrum mode (new in v0.9.2): 48 kHz of spectrum centered on the QMX VFO (14.074 MHz, 20m FT8). The spectrum trace tracks a per-bin noise floor and renders dB-above-floor, so noise collapses to a calm baseline and real signals (here the FT8 pile-up around 14.074) pop sharp above it. Thermal-palette waterfall below uses matching colour and floor maths. Top status bar: band, mode, centre freq, S-meter. Bottom bar: battery, WiFi RSSI, IP. The same view streams live to any browser on the LAN via the web UI — see [Quick start: web UI](#quick-start-web-ui) below.*

### History

The original mockup that drove the design ([panadapter-mockup-ideal.svg](docs/panadapter-mockup-ideal.svg)) and the first real-world screenshot from v0.7 ([QMX-Panadapter_1st_snapshot.png](docs/QMX-Panadapter_1st_snapshot.png)) are kept in `docs/` for reference. The design notes including the expected hardware artifacts (DC spike, I/Q image) live in [docs/panadapter-display-design.md](docs/panadapter-display-design.md).

## Hardware

- **M5Stack Tab5** with ESP32-P4 v1.3 (ECO2) silicon, ST7123 5" 720×1280 MIPI-DSI touch panel, 32 MB hex PSRAM, ESP32-C6 co-processor for WiFi
- **QRP Labs QMX or QMX+** transceiver (Kenwood-style CAT, UAC audio)
- USB data cable from **QMX/QMX+ to the Tab5 USB-A host port**

**Tab5 USB connector rule:**

- **USB-A** is the host connector. Connect the QMX/QMX+ here for CAT (CDC-ACM) and I/Q audio (UAC).
- **USB-C** is for flashing, serial monitor, and battery charging. Do not connect the QMX/QMX+ to the Tab5 USB-C port.
- Normal development wiring is: PC ↔ Tab5 USB-C for flash/monitor, and QMX/QMX+ ↔ Tab5 USB-A for radio data.

## Software requirements

- **ESP-IDF v5.4.4** — pinned, because:
  - ESP32-P4 v1.3 silicon needs `CONFIG_ESP32P4_REV_MIN_0=y` and CPU capped at 360 MHz
  - The local M5Stack UserDemo BSP is built against this IDF version
- VS Code with the Espressif IDF extension (or any IDF-compatible setup)
- Windows 11 + PowerShell (other platforms work fine, just no `qmx` helper)

## Build, flash, monitor

Standard IDF flow:

    idf.py build flash monitor

Or via the helper function in `$PROFILE` (see Tools section below):

    qmx fm      # build + flash + monitor
    qmx b       # build only
    qmx m       # monitor only

Exit monitor with Ctrl+T then Ctrl+X.

## Quick start: web UI

Once the Tab5 is on WiFi (see [WiFi configuration](#wifi-configuration)), it serves both an HTTP status page and a live spectrum/waterfall WebSocket on port 80. Open the Tab5's IP address in any modern browser — the IP is shown in the bottom status bar and in the boot log.

### `/` — status + live spectrum

The landing page mirrors the device screen in real time: spectrum trace updates at ≈10 fps via WebSocket, full waterfall history (≈50 seconds, 512 rows) auto-tracks the noise floor and uses the same thermal palette as the device. Underneath, a live status card shows VFO, battery, WiFi RSSI and the Tab5's own IP.

### `/api/status` — polled status JSON

```json
{
  "battery": { "level": 100, "charging": true },
  "wifi":    { "ssid": "BV50", "rssi": -44, "ip": "192.168.1.213" },
  "freq_hz": 14074000
}
```

Polled by the landing page at 1 Hz; safe to consume from any other client (monitoring scripts, home automation, etc.).

### `/ws` — binary spectrum WebSocket

Single-client endpoint. Each binary frame is 1026 bytes:

| Bytes | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `0`   | Frame type: `0x01` = spectrum |
| `1`   | Reserved (always 0 for now) |
| `2–1025` | 1024 unsigned bytes, each one bin, quantised −130 dBm (q=0) to −30 dBm (q=255) |

Bins are pre-shifted server-side: byte 2 is the leftmost device pixel, byte 1025 the rightmost. The 12 kHz QMX IF offset is already applied, so the QMX dial frequency lands at the visual centre. Push rate is ~10 fps; a new connection refuses if a session is already active.

## Touch-to-tune

- Touch anywhere on spectrum or waterfall → cyan cursor tracks your finger
- Drag to position → cursor follows live
- Lift -> CAT `FA` command sent; QMX retunes; spectrum re-centers on the tapped signal. Rounding is mode-aware (Phase 5.10F): USB/LSB snap to 500 Hz, CW to 10 Hz, FT8/digi to 100 Hz, AM/FM to 1 kHz
- Center cursor (amber, fixed at x=640) marks where the QMX is currently tuned

CAT writes are internally rate-limited to one per 200 ms; rapid taps within that window are dropped silently.



## Top bar, S-meter, settings drawer (Phase 5.10)

The top status bar reads `Band | Mode | Center Freq | Signal` left to right, with the frequency centered. Band and mode come from CAT (FA / MD / FW round-robin poll at 50 ms intervals = each field refreshes every ~150 ms). The band name is derived from the VFO frequency using widened ranges that cover the QMX's tunable region beyond the strict IARU edges. The Signal field shows S-units derived from `dsp_get_peak_dbm_around_vfo(64, ...)` (the peak dBm within +/-64 bins, about +/-3 kHz of the VFO) sampled at 5 Hz in the render task.

Under the spectrum, the frequency axis labels show absolute MHz centered on the VFO (e.g. `13.988 / 13.994 / 14.000 / 14.006 / 14.012` at 48 kHz span), refreshed on every CAT freq update.

**IF offset compensation (Phase 5.10E).** The QMX presents I/Q with a +12 kHz IF offset: the signal at the QMX dial frequency lands at +12 kHz in the baseband. Both `ui_push_spectrum` and `render_waterfall_tick` shift the displayed bin selection right by n_bins/4 so the tuned signal appears at the visual center under the amber VFO marker. Touch-to-tune math is unchanged because `s_last_qmx_freq_hz` is the dial reading, not the LO.

**Waterfall auto-floor (Phase 5.10F).** The waterfall's "darkest color" level is no longer fixed; it tracks the running median of the spectrum once per second (EMA-smoothed, alpha 0.3, clamped -150 to -30 dBm). The dark background therefore follows actual band conditions instead of a hard-coded -130 dBm anchor. The spectrum trace stays user-controlled via the settings drawer (manual ref/range like commercial SDRs).

**Mode-aware tune snap (Phase 5.10F).** Touch-to-tune rounding is mode-dependent: USB / LSB snap to 500 Hz (voice channel grid), CW to 10 Hz (precision), FT8 / digi / RTTY / FSK to 100 Hz, AM / FM to 1 kHz. The current mode is cached from CAT MD into `s_current_mode`.

**Passband indicator (Phase 5.10G).** Two 2-px-wide medium-grey vertical lines mark the QMX receiver's current passband edges. Width comes from CAT FW polling (the QMX returns real values: 300 Hz for CW, 2500 Hz for USB/LSB, 3200 Hz for FSK). Falls back to per-mode defaults if FW reports nothing. Passband geometry is mode-aware: CW/AM/FM are symmetric around the VFO, USB extends from VFO+200 Hz to VFO+200+width, LSB is the mirror, FT8/digi follows USB.

**Faster CAT + optimistic UI (Phase 5.10H).** CAT poll interval dropped from 200 ms to 50 ms so dial-spinning no longer skips. Touch-to-tune optimistically updates the on-screen frequency label immediately on a successful CAT write rather than waiting ~150 ms for the next FA poll to confirm.

**Settings drawer (Phase 5.10D / Phase B).** The burger button on the top right opens a 520 px right-side settings drawer with a 250 ms slide-in animation. Contents:
- **IQ Balance toggle** (Phase B) — ON/OFF switch wired to `iq_balance_set_enabled()`; re-enabling resets the estimator so it converges from a clean state
- **Presets** (HF Normal / HF DX / Strong Sig.) — each sets dB range and EMA smoothing in one tap
- **WiFi** button — opens the credential modal (see WiFi section below)
- **dB Range sliders** (Min and Max in dBm) — live updates `ui_set_db_range()`
- **Smoothing slider** (EMA alpha, 0.05 to 1.00) — live updates `render_set_ema_alpha()` (the formerly hard-coded `SMOOTH_ALPHA` is now a runtime variable)

**Bigger touch targets (Phase 5.10I).** The burger button is 80x80, parented to the screen so it overflows downward into the spectrum area without being clipped by the top bar. The drawer close X is also 80x80. Both icons use Montserrat 32 to fill the button size cleanly. A 200x120 deadzone in the top-right of the spectrum suppresses tunes that overlap the burger button.

## I/Q balance correction (Phases A–C)

The QMX presents I/Q audio over USB UAC with a small but measurable amplitude imbalance and quadrature error between the I and Q channels. Without correction, the result is an "image" of every signal mirrored across the center frequency — a strong signal 10 kHz above center also appears at 10 kHz below center, around 30 dB weaker. This clutters the waterfall and spectrum, especially on a busy band.

**Algorithm (Phase A).** A blind adaptive Gram-Schmidt orthogonaliser runs sample-by-sample in the audio pipeline, before the samples reach the FFT. It maintains running estimates of three statistics:
- **DC offset** on each channel (exponential moving average, τ = 1 s)
- **Power** in I and Q (τ = 200 ms)
- **Cross-product** I·Q (τ = 1 s) — the key signal: non-zero cross-product means the channels are not orthogonal

From these it computes per-sample correction coefficients (`K_phi`, `K_amp`) and applies:

    i_out = i
    q_out = (q - K_phi · i) × K_amp

No calibration step is needed. The estimator converges automatically on ambient band noise within a few seconds of receiving any signal.

**Time constant tuning (Phase C).** A two-speed scheme speeds up initial lock-in: for the first 2 s of real signal after each reset, all three estimators run at 8× their steady-state alpha, giving effective convergence in ~125 ms. After that they drop to their slow steady-state values for stable long-term tracking. The cross-product time constant was also halved (2 s → 1 s) for quicker steady-state response to slow phase drift.

**Toggle (Phase B).** The settings drawer has an IQ Balance ON/OFF switch. Turning it off freezes the estimator (coefficients are preserved but stop updating); turning it back on resets it so it reconverges from a clean state.

The DC spike at bin 0 (caused by a small ADC DC offset, present even with correction active) is separately handled by the one-pole IIR DC blocker in Phase 5.6.

## Spectrum smoothing, dB range, dBm calibration (Phase 5.5 / 5.7 / 5.8)

The spectrum is smoothed per bin with an exponential moving average (α = 0.4) before display, balancing visual stability against the snappy response needed to see real signals (CW, SSB attack).

The displayed dB range is fixed at -130 to -30 dBm, matching commercial SDR convention (HDSDR, SDR Console, Flex Maestro) where the user picks a manual Ref/Range rather than letting the display continuously rescale. Continuous autoscale was tried in Phase 5.4 and removed in 5.5 — it actively hid signal-vs-noise dynamics. The -130 dBm floor and -30 dBm ceiling cover the real signal range from quiet HF noise floor (anchored on dummy load in Phase 5.8) to S9+40 strong signals.

**dBm calibration (Phase 5.8).** The displayed dB values are calibrated against the QMX on a dummy load: with no antenna, the median dB across all bins per second is logged, and `DSP_DB_CALIBRATION_OFFSET` is set to `-130 - median` so the noise floor reads -130 dBm. On this hardware the measured offset is -148.0 dB. S-unit reference: S9 = -73 dBm, S5 ≈ -97 dBm, S1 ≈ -121 dBm. Signals stronger than ~S9+40 (-30 dBm) clip at the display ceiling but still indicate presence at full-scale.

**Continuous green curve (Phase 5.9).** Each column's trace is connected to the previous column's `y_top` with a bright vertical line, so the spectrum reads as a continuous curve rather than disconnected per-column dots. Below the curve, a dim ~25% green fill (RGB565 `0x01C0`) gives the look of [docs/panadapter-mockup-ideal.svg](docs/panadapter-mockup-ideal.svg). Grid lines at -120, -100, -80, -60, -40 dBm.

## WiFi configuration

The Tab5 connects to the local network through the on-board ESP32-C6 co-processor via [`esp_hosted`](https://github.com/espressif/esp-hosted) over SDIO. Once online, SNTP syncs UTC time. By itself this isn't visible to the user beyond a log line, but it satisfies the time-reference prerequisite for the upcoming onboard FT8 decoder, the planned network CAT bridge, and an eventual remote-panadapter web UI.

Credentials are entered through a full-screen LVGL modal launched from the **WiFi** button in the settings drawer.

- **SSID textarea** — pre-filled from NVS on each open, so you can see what's currently configured
- **Password textarea** — masked, always starts blank
- **On-screen keyboard** — appears when a textarea is focused; hides on the keyboard's close-icon or Enter
- **Save / Cancel** buttons

On **Save**, `panadapter_wifi_reconnect(ssid, pass)` is called. This:

1. Writes the new credentials to NVS (32-char SSID, 64-char WPA2 password limits)
2. Triggers a disconnect-then-reconnect cycle so the new SSID takes effect immediately
3. Closes the modal

If no credentials are configured at boot, WiFi stays idle (no retry storm) until the user opens the modal and saves something. Saving an empty SSID is silently ignored — Cancel discards changes and leaves NVS untouched.

**Why a runtime modal instead of build-time `wifi_credentials.h`.** Earlier versions kept SSID/password in a gitignored header. That made every WiFi change a rebuild-and-flash cycle, and required publishing build instructions to teach new users about the file. With the modal, a flashed binary is portable: the user enters their own network on first boot. Credentials are stored only in NVS, never embedded in the firmware image.

## Quirks and trade-offs (read this!)

A few decisions that matter and that someone (including future-me) will otherwise relearn the hard way.

### PI4IO expander must be initialized explicitly before display bring-up

The Tab5's PI4IO I/O expander holds `LCD_RST` and `TP_RST` low at chip power-on. The BSP's `bsp_display_start_with_config` does **not** call `bsp_io_expander_pi4ioe_init` internally. Without it, on a true cold boot the panel never comes out of reset, doesn't respond to DSI commands, and `esp_lcd_new_panel_io_dbi` hangs forever in the read FIFO wait loop.

Soft resets and USB-tethered development mask this entirely: the expander is a separate I²C peripheral that retains its state across ESP32 resets, so LCD_RST and TP_RST stay high from the previous boot.

Our `display_init` calls `bsp_i2c_init()` + `bsp_io_expander_pi4ioe_init(bsp_i2c_get_handle())` at the very start, then waits 120 ms for both chips to come out of reset before letting the BSP probe I²C for the touch controller. Without that delay, the probe runs too fast on cold boot, falls back to ILI9881C panel, then mismatches with the (now-responding) ST7123 touch chip and asserts.

### Patched UAC component lives in `components/`

`espressif/usb_host_uac` was hand-patched in Phase 3.2 to set `create_background_task = true` in `uac_host_install`. Without this, UAC and CDC-ACM cannot coexist on the same USB host on this hardware.

Because the component manager refuses to clean `managed_components/` after a hand-patch, the component was moved permanently to `components/espressif__usb_host_uac/`. **Trade-off:** no auto-updates from the registry. If you want to update it, fetch a fresh copy, re-apply the patch, and replace the directory.

### LVGL software rotation costs ~50% FPS

The ST7123 panel is natively portrait 720×1280 and does *not* implement `esp_lcd_panel_swap_xy`. To get landscape, we use `bsp_display_cfg.sw_rotate=1` plus `lv_display_set_rotation(disp, LV_DISPLAY_ROTATION_90)`.

LVGL rotates every flush in software (`rotate90_rgb565`). Real-world impact on this hardware: spectrum FPS drops from ~22 (portrait) to ~13 (landscape).

Acceptable for a panadapter — commercial radios in this class run 10–15 Hz waterfalls.

**PPA hardware rotation is not usable here.** The ESP32-P4 PPA driver (`CONFIG_LVGL_PORT_ENABLE_PPA`) conflicts with the USB host stack over DW-GDMA channels — enabling it silently breaks UAC and CDC-ACM, so the QMX appears disconnected. Do not set `CONFIG_LVGL_PORT_ENABLE_PPA=y`.

Phase 6.3 (FPS recovery) requires rendering directly in the panel's native 720×1280 portrait coordinates — all widget positions transposed, all canvas drawing code rewritten in portrait — so LVGL never has a rotation step to perform. This is a significant UI rewrite and has not been attempted yet.

### IDLE-task watchdog is disabled

LVGL's rotation pipeline keeps CPU0 busy long enough that the IDLE0 task can't reset its watchdog within the default 5 s. The system isn't actually hung — it just doesn't yield to IDLE. We:

- Disabled `CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_CHECK_IDLE_TASK_CPU0/CPU1`
- Bumped `CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_TIMEOUT_S` from 5 to 30 (safety net for genuinely stuck app tasks)

Real hangs in our app tasks will still be caught. Idle starvation under LVGL load won't generate noise.

### Engineering-sample silicon (ESP32-P4 v1.3)

- Use `CONFIG_ESP32P4_REV_MIN_0=y` (the build will fault `Illegal instruction` if revision is set too high)
- Cap CPU at 360 MHz (`CONFIG_ESP_DEFAULT_CPU_FREQ_MHZ=360`)
- Both already baked into `sdkconfig`

### Waterfall scroll trick

We allocate the waterfall canvas at 2× height (1280×824 RGB565). Each tick writes the new row at both `s_wf_head` and `s_wf_head + WATERFALL_H`, then decrements `s_wf_head` (with wrap). The canvas view pointer is moved through the buffer instead of `memmove`-ing. ~130 µs/tick instead of ~92 ms/tick.

### Noise floor pumping on QMX I/Q (resolved in Phase 5.7)

Earlier versions of the panadapter showed a slow ~13 s cycle on the displayed noise floor: ~6 s at a high level (~104 dB mean), then a 7 s descending ramp back to a low floor, then a sharp jump back up. The same QMX into HDSDR or an iPad SDR app showed a flat steady noise floor, so the I/Q stream out of the QMX was always clean.

**Root cause:** data starvation in our event-driven `audio_task`. Non-blocking `uac_host_device_read` calls on core 1 periodically returned truncated chunks. The decoder's `peak L/R` saturated at 16384 every period (an artifact of the broken pipeline, not real signal amplitude), and the FFT input acquired periodic step discontinuities which spread broadband energy across all bins on a slow envelope.

**Fix (commit `6d3d968`):** replicate qrp_companion's `mic_task` producer-side architecture:
- Polling loop on core 0 priority 3 (was event-driven on core 1 priority 5)
- `uac_host_device_read` with 25 ms timeout
- Drain loop inside `process_rx` reads until the UAC driver returns 0 bytes
- `RX_BUF_BYTES` raised from 4096 to 19200 to match the UAC internal buffer
- 24-bit → 16-bit scaling restored to `>> 8` (the Phase 5.5 `>> 9` was a misdiagnosis)
- Display dB range shifted to 10–130 dB to cover real signal amplitudes (later recalibrated to -130 to -30 dBm in Phase 5.8)

Inspired by [`qrp_companion`](https://groups.io/g/QRPLabs/topic/118645485) by Zhenxing Han (N6HAN), who confirmed his code on Tab5 did not exhibit the issue and offered his source as reference. Thanks Zhenxing.

Two stacked issues had to be worked around before WiFi STA would come up reliably:

- **Symbol collision on `wifi_start`.** Our `wifi.c` originally exposed `void wifi_start(void)`, which collides with `esp_hosted`'s internal `wifi_start(req)`. With `esp_hosted` linked under `-Wl,--whole-archive`, the linker picked the wrong symbol and WiFi never started. Fix: rename our public entry point to `panadapter_wifi_start`. **Lesson:** never use generic names like `wifi_start`/`stop`/`connect` for module exports — prefix with the module name.
- **`esp_hosted` constructor doesn't auto-fire.** `esp_hosted_host_init.c` uses `__attribute__((constructor))` to initialise the SDIO transport before `app_main` runs. On this build it doesn't fire (root cause unknown — not blocking). Workaround: call `esp_hosted_init()` explicitly at the start of `wifi_task`.

## Tools

### `qmx` PowerShell helper

Add to your `$PROFILE`. Adjust the COM port and IDF path:

    function qmx {
        param([string]$cmd = "fm")
        if (-not $env:IDF_PATH) {
            & C:\esp\v5.4.4\esp-idf\export.ps1
        }
        switch ($cmd) {
            "b"   { idf.py build }
            "f"   { idf.py flash }
            "m"   { python -m esp_idf_monitor -p COM3 build\qmx_panadapter.elf }
            "fm"  { idf.py flash; python -m esp_idf_monitor -p COM3 build\qmx_panadapter.elf }
            "bfm" { idf.py build flash; python -m esp_idf_monitor -p COM3 build\qmx_panadapter.elf }
        }
    }

Exit monitor with `Ctrl+T` then `Ctrl+X` (works on Danish/non-US keyboard layouts where `Ctrl+]` is awkward).

## Roadmap

### Shipped in v0.7.0

- **Hidden long-press screenshot** (Phase 5.11). Top-left 80x80 corner, 1 sec hold. Base64 streamed over UART; Python decoder saves PNG to `~/Downloads`.
- **I/Q balance correction** (Phases A–C). Gram-Schmidt blind adaptive image-rejection; toggle in settings drawer.
- **NVS settings persistence**. dB range, EMA alpha and IQ toggle survive reboots. Debounced flush minimises flash wear.

### Shipped in v0.8.0

- **WiFi STA + on-screen credential UI.** ESP32-C6 co-processor over `esp_hosted` SDIO; SSID/password entered via a full-screen LVGL modal launched from the settings drawer; creds persist to NVS, no rebuild required to change networks. SNTP syncs UTC on connect — this is the prerequisite for onboard FT8 decoding.

### Shipped in v0.8.1

- **Bottom status bar.** Battery indicator (level + charging) and WiFi state (SSID + RSSI in dBm) replace the dev-only FPS/PSRAM/IRAM line. Battery readout is stubbed pending INA226 wiring (see N6HAN's qrp_companion for the planned approach).
- **Drawer polish.** Drawer widened from 400 px to 520 px; IQ Balance row moved up under the title; presets (HF Normal / HF DX / Strong Sig) laid out side-by-side in a single row; on-screen keyboard buttons darker for better contrast.
- **Larger fonts.** Top-bar and bottom-bar text bumped from Montserrat 20 to Montserrat 24 to match the drawer.

### Shipped in v0.9.2

- **Flat-spectrum mode.** The spectrum trace can now render against a per-bin tracked noise floor instead of absolute dBm. Noise variance collapses to a calm baseline near the bottom of the canvas; real signals pop sharp above it, matching the design mockup. Algorithm is identical browser-side and device-side: temporal EMA on incoming bins, asymmetric per-bin EMA floor (slow-up / faster-down so signals don't drag their own floor up), 5-bin spatial smoothing on the rendered trace, floor bias to lift the visible zero above the canvas bottom. Toggleable on both sides: browser via the `f` keypress, device via a `Flat Spectrum` switch in the settings drawer. NVS-persisted on the device so it survives reboots.
- **Screenshot mutex fix** (originally tagged as v0.9.1). The Phase 5.11 screenshot helper used a non-blocking display lock and could capture a partially-rendered frame, visible as a wrapped bottom status bar in the v0.9.0 hero image. Switching to `bsp_display_lock(portMAX_DELAY)` waits for the in-flight LVGL operation to finish before the snapshot starts.
- **Known issue.** The `-30 dBm` / `-130 dBm` axis labels at the left edge of the spectrum are still drawn in flat mode. They are misleading there because the axis is dB-above-floor, not absolute dBm. Will be hidden in a follow-up patch.

### Shipped in v0.9.0

- **Web UI.** Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 of the remote panadapter front-end landed together: an HTTP status page on `/`, a polled `/api/status` JSON endpoint, and a binary `/ws` WebSocket streaming the live spectrum at ~10 fps. The browser canvas renders a continuous-curve spectrum (matching the device aesthetic) and a full waterfall with auto-tracking noise floor. See [Quick start: web UI](#quick-start-web-ui).
- **Unified visual identity.** Tab5 device and browser now share the same thermal waterfall palette (black→dark blue→teal→green→yellow→red), the same auto-tracking floor maths (median + 6 dB bias, 30 dB dynamic range above floor), and the same closed-polyline spectrum rendering. A signal of given strength looks the same in both places.
- **Pixel-perfect screenshots.** The Phase 5.11 long-press screenshot infrastructure now reliably round-trips through `tools/screenshot_decode.py` — the headline image of this README is its own output.
- **ESP-DSP fallback to portable C FFT.** The ESP32-P4 PIE/vector FFT (`dsps_fft2r_fc32_arp4.S`) crashed deterministically under sustained WebSocket load; falling back to `CONFIG_DSP_ANSI=y` removed the failure mode at the cost of ~10% FPS (35–42 vs 40–45). TODO: revisit once upstream esp-dsp PIE preemption handling matures.

### Shipped in v0.8.2

- **Battery charging enabled.** The Tab5 BSP defines `bsp_set_charge_en()` but never calls it; v0.8.2 wires it (with QuickCharge negotiation) into `app_main` so the cell actually tops up when USB-C is connected.
- **Real INA226 battery readout.** Bottom bar now shows the actual battery percentage and charge state. Small dedicated I2C driver (`main/util/ina226.c`) reads the INA226 at address 0x41 on the main BSP bus. Voltage-to-SoC math and charging-detection thresholds informed by Zhenxing Han (N6HAN)'s qrp_companion battery indicator notes, in particular that on the Tab5 INA226 polarity is inverted vs the M5Unified docstring (negative shunt current = charging).
- **Last VFO persisted.** The last QMX frequency is saved to NVS on every CAT FA update (debounced, no flash churn) and shown immediately at boot. CAT then corrects within ~50 ms if the QMX has moved while the Tab5 was off.
- **Build noise cleanup.** Stale forward declaration removed; two BSP unused-variable warnings silenced with `(void)` casts.

### Next up

Concrete items planned for the near term, in roughly the order they'll likely be tackled.

- **Memory channels.** Quick-recall frequency presets — touch a slot, QMX retunes via CAT. Stored in NVS.
- **FT8 decoder onboard.** Integrate [`ft8_lib`](https://github.com/kgoba/ft8_lib) using the existing audio pipeline. The required UTC reference is now in place via SNTP. Show decoded callsigns/grids overlaid on the spectrum at their carrier frequencies.
- **DSP polish.** Noise reduction, auto-notch — the feature surface the QuantumSDR Spectrum DSP M4 defines as the boutique-standalone target.
- **Phase 6.3 — Native-orientation rendering** *(deferred)*. First attempt in v0.6.x was reverted; UI elements were half-migrated. Worth revisiting once memory channels and FT8 land, since the ~50% FPS recovery is real. PPA hardware rotation ruled out earlier — it conflicts with the USB host stack over DW-GDMA channels.

### Longer term

Ideas that fit the project but aren't on the immediate path. Order is rough; appetite and curiosity will decide.

- **Hide dBm axis labels in flat mode.** Known issue carried over from v0.9.2: the `-30 dBm` / `-130 dBm` labels at the left edge of the spectrum still render in flat mode, where the axis is dB-above-floor and the labels are misleading. Small fix.
- **Flat-mode tunables in the drawer.** Currently the per-bin floor parameters (`FLAT_FLOOR_BIAS_DB`, `FLAT_RANGE_DB`, smoothing alphas) are compile-time constants. Sliders in the settings drawer plus NVS persistence would let people tune the look without rebuilding.
- **Network CAT bridge.** TCP server forwarding CAT to the QMX, so WSJT-X / fldigi / N1MM on a PC can talk to the radio through the Tab5 — useful when the QMX is in the shack and the operating position is elsewhere. WiFi STA already in place.
- **CW decoder.** A Goertzel-based decoder on the demodulated CW passband, with text scrolling under the spectrum. The QMX itself already does this internally; question is whether to mirror its output via CAT or run a parallel decoder on the Tab5.
- **QMX (small) support.** Same UI, different USB endpoint config and band table. Should be mostly a build-flag matter; the 5-band QMX speaks the same CAT and UAC.
- **Extended waterfall history.** PSRAM has plenty of room for several minutes of scrollback. Two-finger drag to scrub through history would be a natural UX fit.
- **Touch-to-tune refinements.** Pinch-to-zoom span (sub-48 kHz windows), drag-to-pan inside the current 48 kHz, snap-to-strongest-bin, configurable cursor offset for CW tone preference.
